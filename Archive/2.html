  <p>You know what I think?" she says.<br>
    That people's memories are maybe the fuel they burn to stay alive.<br> 
    Whether those memories have any actual importance or not, <br>
    it doesn't matter as far as the maintenance of life is concerned. <br>
    <br>
    They're all just fuel. Advertising fillers in the newspaper, philosophy books, <br>
    dirty pictures in a magazine, a bundle of ten-thousand-yen bills: <br>
    <br>
    when you feed 'em to the fire, they're all just paper.<br>
    The fire isn't thinking, 'Oh, this is Kant,' or <br>
    'Oh, this is the Yomiuri evening edition,' or <br>
    'Nice tits,' while it burns. <br>
    <br>
    To the fire, they're nothing but scraps of paper. <br>
    It's the exact same thing. Important memories, <br>
    not-so-important memories, totally useless memories: <br>
    there's no distinction—they're all just fuel.<br>
    <br>
    -Haruki Murakami

  <p style="text-align: right;">
  No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. 
  <br>At its deepest and most painful, 
  <br>it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, 
  <br>often without any specific cause. 
  <br><br>At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, 
  <br>a longing with nothing to long for, 
  <br>a sick pining, a vague restlessness, 
  <br>mental throes, yearning. 
  <br><br>In particular cases it may be the desire for 
  <br>somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. 
  <br>At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.
  <br><br> ― Vladimir Nabokov</p>

  <p>Black angel on white snow,<br>
    reduced a hundredfold by a gloomy magician.<br>
    Death is sorrowful, but to live, I cannot.<br>
    In the bleak park no one is about.<br>
    In the bleak park there is always silence,<br>
    and a pine tree — like a stranger — stands.<br>
    Lean up against it, partake of the wine,<br>
    that lies — by the heart — in the pocket.<br>
    I made to recollect; but<br>
    at first it humiliated and then it killed.<br>
    It's overly cold in this light coat.<br>
    The angel beats its black wings.<br>
    — Fly to your heaven, my dear,<br>
    and recount, as if god were still alive:<br>
    it's still, he says, winter, still peaceful,<br>
    just some fool being lonely.</p>

  <p style="text-align: right;">Somebody's pound of flesh rendered up.</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">Wrinkled with secrets</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">and hard with the intention to kepp them.</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">Why, from silvery peach-bloom,</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">from that shallow-silvery wine-glass on a short stem</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">This rolling, dropping, heavy globule?</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">I am thinking, of course, of the peach before I ate it.</p>

    I realized a while ago that anyone who offputs medical procedures is likely <em>depressed</em>, 
    <br>feels <em>hopeless</em>, and the pain is a reminder to just do it but you can't mentally get yourself 
    <br>to do it which translates into even more  <em> depression and resentment </em> ☆  </p>
<br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Death is a bend in the road,<br>
To die is to slip out of view.<br>
If I listen, I hear your steps<br>
Existing as I exist.<br>
<br>
The earth is made of heaven.<br>
Error has no nest.<br>
No one has ever been lost.<br>
All is truth and way.<br>

  <p>When you've been pushing hard trying to find motivation,<br>
   you'll find out that you were motivated enough to keep yourself going<br>
   and looking for that motivation for years, and when you find this out,<br>
   the next thing you gotta look for is a route.<br>
   You don't need a way out of it because you're already out of it and<br>
   you don't need to feel constantly good to do anything because<br>
   drugs have already proven to you that feeling that good is a fleeting thing and<br>
   you never really do anything worthwhile with yourself while you're feeling "good".<br> 
   You're basically a dart that's going way too fast, <br>
   thinking about how to find "something that will give you the energy to hit the bullseye",<br>
   but all you're missing is the choice of which dartboard you wanna hit. <br>
  After all, you're already in mid-air, going faster than you wish you were.

  <p>To realize that all your life—you know,<br> 
  all your love, all your hate,<br> all your memories,<br> 
  all your pain—it was all the same thing.<br>

  </p> <br><br><br> <center> We wait and think and doubt and hate.<br> 
    How does it make you feel?<br>
     The overwhelming feeling is rage.<br>
      We hate ourself for being unable to be other than what we are.<br>
       Unable to be better.<br>
        We feel rage.<br>
         The feelings must be followed.<br>
         It doesn't matter whether you're an ideologue or a sensualist,<br>
          you follow the stimuli thinking that they're your signposts to the promised land.<br>
           But they are nothing of the kind.<br>
            What they are is rocks to navigate the past,<br>
             each on your brush against,<br>
              ripping you a little more open and they are always more on the horizon.<br>
               But you can't face up to the that,<br> 
               so you force yourself to believe the bullshit of those you 
               <br>instinctively know are liars and you repeat those lies to yourself and to others,<br>
                hoping that by repeating them often and fervently enough 
                <br>you'll attain the godlike status we accord those <br>
                who tell the lies most frequently and most passionately.<br>
                 But you never do,<br>
                  and even if you could,<br>
                   you wouldn't value it,<br>
                    you'd realise that nobody believes in heroes any more.<br>
                     We know that they only want to sell us something 
                     <br>we don't really want and keep from us what we really do need. <br>
                     Maybe that's a good thing. 
                     <br>Maybe we're getting in touch with our condition at last. 
                     <br>It's horrible how we always die alone, <br>
                     but no worse than living alone.
